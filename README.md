# Belarc-Advisor
Belarc Advisor is a free system information tool that provides a detailed report of a computer's hardware and software configuration. It gathers information about the operating system, processor, memory, hard drives, network adapters, printers, and other installed hardware, as well as installed software, updates, and licenses. The report generated by Belarc Advisor includes a summary of the system's overall health and security, including any missing updates or patches, and can be useful for system administrators and IT professionals to assess and manage their systems. The tool is compatible with Windows operating systems and can be downloaded and installed easily from the Belarc website.
